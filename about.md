Hi, my name is Joao Rodrigues and currently I am playing the role of software engineer. In my current job I'm in charge of use new technologies to develop functional and non-functional requirements of a IoT application responsible to delivery water in remote areas of Brazil. I'm always studying and learning new technologies, the main source of knowledge I'm using are books, but, recently I started to study open source projects (Spring umbrella projects). 

I have more than 10 years working with web technologies using a wide range of languages (like Java, ASP and Python -- recently I started to learn GO).

In my previous experiences I was able to act as software architect (as technical leader, scrum master and responsible to leverage the applications infrastructure) and software engineer acting directly in development of new requirements of a IoT application.
