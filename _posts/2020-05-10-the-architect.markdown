## What is a software architect?

# Defining software architecture
* structure of the system (microservices, layered, etc)
* Architecture characteristics (success criteria, I need to understand this better)
* Architecture decisions (rules for how the system should be constructed; such as restricting access to the database - introduces the variances)
* Design principles (differ from Architecture Decisions because it creates guideline rather than a rule)

# Expectations of an architect
* Make architecture decisions

define the architecture decisions and principles used to guide technology decisions within the team

* Continually analyse the architecture

continually analyse the architecture and current technology environment and then recommend solutions for improvement - architecture vitality

* Keep current with latest trends

understanding the current trends helps the architect prepare for the future and make correct decisions

* Ensure compliance with decisions

continuously verify that development teams are following the architecture decisions and design principle defined to ensure that the system will work as expected; database access as example

* Diverse exposure and experience

focus on technical breadth rather than technical depth

* Have business domain knowledge

needed in order to justify the architectural decisions and principles to C-level executives and business areas

* Possess interpersonal skills 

teamwork, facilitation and leadership; including coaching and mentoring

* Understand and navigate politics 

almost every decision an architect makes will be challenged


# Intersection of Architecture and...

* Engineering practices
* Operations and DevOps
* Process
* Data

# Laws of Software Architecture


* 1st: "Everything in software architecture is a trade-off"

 If an architect thinks they have discovered something that isn't a trade-off, more likely the just haven't identified the trade-off yet. 

* 2nd: "Why is more important than how"

It's more important to understand why a decision was made the how it was implemented.
